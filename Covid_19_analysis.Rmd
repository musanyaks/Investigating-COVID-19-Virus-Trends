## Objectives.

This project is about building my skills of the data analysis workflow by evaluating the COVID_19 situation.

# Data exploration

```{r }
#loading data set
options(warn = -1)
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
df<-read.csv("covid19.csv")

head(df)
```


```{r}
#number of rows and columns
dim(df)

#viewing column names and storinh them in a variable
col_names<- colnames(df)

#install.packages("skimr") for skimming through the data set

#skimming through the data
library(skimr)
skim(df)
col_names

#viewing  and summarising data
glimpse(df)
```
From above analysis I have used ``tidyverse`` and ``skimr`` package to give all overview of the data set. The data set has 14 colums and 10903 rows. It has 5 columns with character and 9 columns with numeric. From above, the data has no missing values.The ``glimpse`` function also show an overview of the all columns but ``skim`` function from ``skimr`` package give more details than what ``glimpse`` function which is in the umbrella of a group of packages hold by ``tidyverse``.  
 
 
```{r}
#filter the ``all states`` province state and remove the Province_state column
covid_allstates <- df %>% filter(Province_State == "All States") %>% select(-Province_State)

```
 From above snippet of code we have removed one column and it consist only All state row.
 
# Isolating the Columns We Need
- Creating a dataset for the daily columns from `covid_df_all_states` dataframe

Let's recall the description of the dataset's columns.

1. `Date`: Date
2. `Continent_Name`: Continent names
3. `Two_Letter_Country_Code`: Country codes
4. `Country_Region`: Country names
5. `Province_State`: States/province names; value is `All States` when state/provincial level data is not available
6. `positive`: Cumulative number of positive cases reported.
7. `active`: Number of actively cases on that **day**.
8. `hospitalized`: Cumulative number of hospitalized cases reported.
9. `hospitalizedCurr`: Number of actively hospitalized cases on that **day**.
10. `recovered`: Cumulative number of recovered cases reported.
11. `death`: Cumulative number of deaths reported.
12. `total_tested`: Cumulative number of tests conducted.
13. `daily_tested`: Number of tests conducted on the **day**; if daily data is unavailable, daily tested is averaged across number of days in between.
14. `daily_positive`: Number of positive cases reported on the **day**; if daily data is unavailable, daily positive is averaged across number of days in.
```{r}
# Selecting the columns with cumulative numbers
# Selecting the columns with cumulative numbers
covid_df_all_states_daily <- df %>% 
  select(Date, Country_Region, active, hospitalizedCurr, daily_tested, daily_positive)
head(covid_df_all_states_daily)

```

# Extracting the Top Ten countries in the number of tested cases

## Summarizing the data based on the `Country_Region` column.
```{r}
covid_df_all_states_daily_sum <- covid_df_all_states_daily %>% 
  group_by(Country_Region) %>% 
  summarise(tested = sum(daily_tested), 
            positive = sum(daily_positive),
            active = sum(active),
            hospitalized = sum(hospitalizedCurr)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(tested)) #this is equivalent to `arrange(-tested)`
covid_df_all_states_daily_sum
#Date, Country_Region, active, hospitalizedCurr, daily_tested, daily_positive
```
## Taking the top 10 
```{r}
covid_top_10 <- head(covid_df_all_states_daily_sum, 10)
covid_top_10
```

# Identifying the Highest Positive Against Tested Cases

## Getting vectors
```{r}
countries <- covid_top_10$Country_Region
tested_cases <- covid_top_10$tested
positive_cases <- covid_top_10$positive
active_cases <- covid_top_10$active
hospitalized_cases <- covid_top_10$hospitalized
```

## Naming vectors
```{r}
names(positive_cases) <- countries
names(tested_cases) <- countries
names(active_cases) <- countries
names(hospitalized_cases) <- countries
```

## Identifying 

```{r}
positive_cases
sum(positive_cases)
mean(positive_cases)
positive_cases/sum(positive_cases)
```


```{r}
positive_cases/tested_cases
```

## Conclusion
```{r}
positive_tested_top_3 <- c("United Kingdom" = 0.11, "United States" = 0.10, "Turkey" = 0.08)
```


# Keeping relevant information
```{r}
# Creating vectors
united_kingdom <- c(0.11, 1473672, 166909, 0, 0)
united_states <- c(0.10, 17282363, 1877179, 0, 0)
turkey <- c(0.08, 2031192, 163941, 2980960, 0)
# Creating the matrix covid_mat
covid_mat <- rbind(united_kingdom, united_states, turkey)
# Naming columns
colnames(covid_mat) <- c("Ratio", "tested", "positive", "active", "hospitalized")
#d Displaying the matrix
covid_mat
```

# Putting all together

```{r}
question <- "Which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?"
answer <- c("Positive tested cases" = positive_tested_top_3)
datasets <- list(
  original = df,
  allstates = covid_allstates,
  daily = covid_df_all_states_daily,
  top_10 = covid_top_10
)
matrices <- list(covid_mat)
vectors <- list(col_names, countries)
data_structure_list <- list("dataframe" = datasets, "matrix" = matrices, "vector" = vectors)
covid_analysis_list <- list(question, answer, data_structure_list)
covid_analysis_list[[2]]
